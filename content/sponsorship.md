# Sponsor elm-conf

[(download this page as a PDF)](./elm-conf_2019_Sponsorship_Prospectus.pdf)

## Overview:

elm-conf is a single-day, one-track conference for the Elm programming language community. As in prior years, elm-conf takes place on the Strange Loop preconference day, September 12, at Union Station in St. Louis.

As a sponsor of elm-conf, you’ll have the opportunity to connect and recruit at the longest-running annual gathering of Elm developers in the world! Last year about 250 people attended elm-conf. Your sponsorship helps us bring in great speakers and provide a fun, accessible, and safe event, and allows you to recruit and promote your company on the conference day. Sponsors in past years include NoRedInk, thoughtbot, and Ableton.

Please contact the organizing team at [elm-conf@thestrangeloop.com](mailto:elm-conf@thestrangeloop.com) with any questions or to purchase sponsorship packages.

Sponsoring captioning allows you to feature your logo in our recorded videos and
expand your reach beyond the conference day.
