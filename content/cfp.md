We invite speakers of all levels to submit talk proposals from April 5 to May 5. We will give direct feedback on all proposals submitted before April 28. All proposals will be evaluated anonymously, and we intend to notify selected speakers no later than May 15. You can submit as many talks as you like. If you would like feedback on a talk idea before you submit it, please email us at [elm-conf@thestrangeloop.com](mailto:elm-conf@thestrangeloop.com).
