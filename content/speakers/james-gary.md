## James' Talk: *Game Development in Elm: Build your own tooling*

Building games is in Elm is a joy. The safety makes defining your rules easy, but what about defining your ""magic numbers"", like enemy speed, jump height, or explosion duration? While traditional web development involves fairly static expectations, game development is an exploratory and boundless journey. Getting that ""juicy"" game feel is tricky using just a text editor. Without game engine tooling you'd find in frameworks like Unity, how can we shorten the feedback loop? Build our own tooling!

In this talk, you'll learn the benefits of having immediate feedback, and how to introduce tooling to your project to get that perfect look'n'feel.
