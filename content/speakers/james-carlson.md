# James Carlson

What do you do when Elm is too slow?  This can easily happen when running simulations of physical processes, agent-based models in the social sciences, statistical computations, or just a very large and complex version of the Game of Life.  Fear not!  There is a solution: Futhark, a statically typed, pure functional language that compiles to optimized GPU code. And that means FAST! In this talk, we'll give a quick overview of Futhark, describe how to rig up a Futhark compute server, and how to wire it to an Elm front end.
