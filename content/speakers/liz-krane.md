# Liz Krane

Through a series of animated demos and funny failed experiments, join me on my journey towards building a musical game where the controller is a digital piano!

Highlights include:

  - Using the Web MIDI API with Elm via JavaScript interop to get input from a digital piano directly in the web browser
  - Exploring SVG animations in the Elm ecosystem
  - Elm's best features from the perspective of a beginner who recently fell in love with the language
  - Silly and instructive beginner mistakes (how not to use Elm!)

Building my first Elm app was a two-for-one deal: learn functional programming and learn to sight-read sheet music! By the end of this talk, I hope you'll be equally excited to combine these web technologies in your own creative adventures.
