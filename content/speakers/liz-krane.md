# Liz Krane

Liz Krane is a developer advocate at Sentry and founder of Learn Teach Code, an organization that empowers aspiring developers to lead their own local events to create stronger, more diverse tech communities. She loves finding new ways to combine code with other disciplines like art and music, sharing everything she learns while she tries to learn everything!

## Liz's Talk: *Building a Music Learning Game with Elm, Web MIDI, and SVG Animation*

Through a series of animated demos and funny failed experiments, join me on my journey towards building a musical game where the controller is a digital piano!

Highlights include:

  - Using the Web MIDI API with Elm via JavaScript interop to get input from a digital piano directly in the web browser
  - Exploring SVG animations in the Elm ecosystem
  - Elm's best features from the perspective of a beginner who recently fell in love with the language
  - Silly and instructive beginner mistakes (how not to use Elm!)

Building my first Elm app was a two-for-one deal: learn functional programming and learn to sight-read sheet music! By the end of this talk, I hope you'll be equally excited to combine these web technologies in your own creative adventures.
