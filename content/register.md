We invite speakers of all levels to submit proposals for 30-minute talks from April 1 to May 15. We will give direct feedback on all proposals submitted before May 1. All proposals will be evaluated anonymously, and we intend to notify selected speakers no later than May 31. You can submit as many talks as you like. If you would like feedback on a talk idea before you submit it, please email us at [elm-conf@thestrangeloop.com](mailto:elm-conf@thestrangeloop.com).
